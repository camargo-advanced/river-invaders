# River Invaders
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:  
Implementation of a game inspired on River Raid AND Space Invaders arcade games using Pygame Zero framework.
  
#### Game objective:  
- Make the most points by eliminating enemies. Be careful as you can be destroyed if you touch an enemy or if you step outside the river's edge.  
- With each stage, the difficulty of the game increases.  
- To move the ship use LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys.  
- To increase and reduce speed of the ship use UP and DOWN arrow keys.  
- To fire, press SPACE BAR.  
  
#### Inspiration:  
At first I thought about making the Pong game, which was the first video game I had as a child and using the Pygame language. However, when watching the seminar "Making Small-Scale 2D Games with LÃ–VE 2D and Lua" where a reference link to the site [Simple Game Tutorials](https://simplegametutorials.github.io) was passed, I saw that there was also mention of Pygame Zero (which I never heard of it before). As I'm looking to evolve in Python, I decided to give Pygame Zero a chance for the appeal of having a faster development than Pygame. I saw some examples and liked it so I decided to follow this line.  
But I realized that it was actually faster to develop with Pygame Zero and so I thought about making another more complex game. I thought about Space Invaders (which I loved too) but for fear of copyright problems, I decided to create something different. As I also liked River Raid, I decided to combine the two and create River Invaders!
